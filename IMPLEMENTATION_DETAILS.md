# CSV Batch Upload & Product Editing Implementation Details

## Overview
This implementation adds CSV batch upload functionality and product editing capabilities to the admin upload page, with proper admin-only access controls.

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/routes/products.js`
**Changes:**

**New Endpoints:**

#### PUT /api/products/:id

- **Request Body:** JSON with product fields (name, description, price, type, subcategory, stock, options, image)
- **Validation:** 
  - MongoDB ObjectId format check
  - Required field validation (name, description, price, type)
- **Response:** Updated product object or error

#### POST /api/products/batch
- **Authentication:** Requires admin token (firebaseAdminAuth)
- **Purpose:** Upload multiple products via CSV data
- **Request Body:** JSON with `products` array
- **Validation:**
  - Array must contain 1-100 products
  - Each product must have name, description, and price
- **Response:** Success/error results for each product

### 2. `public/admin/upload.html`

#### New JavaScript Functions:
1. **CSV Upload Handler**

   - Maps CSV columns to product schema
   - Sends batch request to backend
   - Displays detailed success/error results

2. **Load Products Handler**
   - Fetches all products from backend
   - Displays products in a table format
   - Shows Name, Price, Stock, Type, and Actions columns
   - Stores products globally for edit functionality

3. **Edit Product Function** (`window.editProduct`)
   - Opens edit modal with pre-filled form
   - Populates all product fields
   - Handles image uploads to Firebase Storage
   - Sends update request to backend
   - Refreshes product list on success

4. **Delete Product Function** (`window.deleteProduct`)
   - Confirms deletion with user
   - Requires admin authentication
   - Sends DELETE request to backend
   - Refreshes product list on success

5. **Edit Form Submit Handler**
   - Validates form inputs
   - Uploads new image if provided
   - Sends PUT request with updated data
   - Shows success/error messages
   - Auto-closes modal on success

### 3. `package.json`
**Changes:**
- Added `papaparse` dependency (version automatically determined by npm)

### 4. New Files Created

#### `sample-products.csv`
- Example CSV file with 3 sample products
- Demonstrates proper CSV format
- Includes various product types and options

#### `CSV_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`
- Comprehensive documentation for CSV upload feature
- Format specifications
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security information

## CSV Format Support

The implementation supports flexible CSV formats:

### Supported Column Names (case-insensitive):
- `name` or `TITLE` → Product name
- `description` or `DESCRIPTION` → Product description
- `price` or `PRICE` → Product price
- `type` → Product type (default: "decor")
- `subcategory` → Product subcategory
- `stock` or `QUANTITY` → Stock quantity (default: 1)
- `options` → Comma-separated options
- `image` or `IMAGE1` → Product image URL

This allows the system to work with both custom CSV files and Etsy export formats.

## Security Features

### Admin Authentication
- All write operations (create, update, delete) require admin authentication
- Uses Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
- Only authorized admin emails can perform these operations

### Input Validation
- MongoDB ObjectId format validation for product IDs
- Required field validation for all operations
- Batch size limitation (100 products max)
- Type checking for numeric fields (price, stock)

### CodeQL Security Analysis
The implementation was analyzed with CodeQL. Findings:
- **Rate Limiting Alerts**: Present but acceptable as all endpoints are protected by admin authentication
- **SQL Injection Alert**: False positive (MongoDB uses BSON, not SQL, and we use safe Mongoose methods)

## User Experience Improvements

### CSV Upload Flow:
1. Admin selects CSV file
2. Clicks "Upload CSV" button
3. System parses and validates CSV
4. Displays detailed results:
   - Number of successful uploads
   - List of uploaded products with IDs
   - Number of failures
   - Specific error messages for failed rows

### Product Management Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Load All Products"
2. System displays all products in table
3. Admin can:
   - Edit any product (opens modal)
   - Delete any product (with confirmation)

### Edit Product Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Edit" button for a product
2. Modal opens with pre-filled form
3. Admin modifies desired fields
4. Optionally uploads new image
5. Clicks "Save Changes"
6. Success message displays
7. Modal auto-closes
8. Product list refreshes

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **CSV Upload**:
   - Upload sample-products.csv
   - Verify all 3 products are created
   - Check error handling with invalid CSV

2. **Product Editing**:
   - Load products list
   - Edit a product's name, price, and stock
   - Verify changes persist
   - Test image upload functionality

3. **Product Deletion**:
   - Delete a product
   - Verify it's removed from database
   - Check it doesn't appear in products list

4. **Authentication**:
   - Test without login (should fail)
   - Test with non-admin user (should fail)
   - Test with admin user (should succeed)

### Edge Cases:
- CSV with 101 products (should be rejected)
- CSV with missing required fields
- CSV with invalid price values
- Edit with invalid MongoDB ObjectId
- Delete non-existent product

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add rate limiting middleware for additional security
2. Implement CSV export functionality
3. Add product search/filter in management view
4. Support bulk editing (multiple products at once)
5. Add product image preview in management view
6. Implement undo/redo for product changes
7. Add audit logging for product modifications
8. Support for additional CSV formats (Excel, etc.)
