**Media Utility (backend/utils/media.js)**
- ✓ Module imports successfully
- ✓ normalizeImageUrl('') returns ''
- ✓ normalizeImageUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg') returns absolute URL unchanged
- ✓ normalizeImageUrl('/admin/uploads/test.jpg') returns relative path when BACKEND_URL not set
- ✓ normalizeImageUrl('relative/path.jpg') normalizes to '/relative/path.jpg'
- ✓ normalizeProduct(product) returns product with normalized image URL

### 3. Dependency Tests ✓
**Helmet**
- ✓ helmet package imported successfully
- ✓ Can be used as middleware

**Express Rate Limit**
- ✓ express-rate-limit package imported successfully
- ✓ Rate limiter instance created successfully with config

### 4. Frontend JavaScript Tests ✓
**escapeHtml Function**
- ✓ Escapes < to &lt;
- ✓ Escapes > to &gt;
- ✓ Escapes " to &quot;
- ✓ Escapes ' to &#039;
- ✓ Escapes & to &amp;
- ✓ Returns empty string for empty/null input
- ✓ Leaves normal text unchanged

## Manual Testing Required

The following tests should be performed in a staging/production environment with MongoDB and Firebase configured:

### Backend Testing

1. **Server Startup**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Expected: Server starts without errors, logs show [INFO] prefixes

2. **Security Headers**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-backend-url/api/products
   ```
   Expected: Response includes Helmet security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)

3. **Global Rate Limiting (60/minute)**
   ```bash
   for i in {1..65}; do
     curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://your-backend-url/api/products
   done
   ```
   Expected: First 60 requests = 200, remaining = 429

4. **Admin Rate Limiting (10/minute)**
   ```bash
   TOKEN="your-admin-token"
   for i in {1..15}; do
     curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/products/batch \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"products": [{"name": "Test '$i'", "price": 10}]}' \
       -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
   done
   ```
   Expected: First 10 requests succeed, remaining = 429

5. **Image URL Normalization**
   Test with products having:
   - Absolute URLs (Firebase Storage) → returned as-is
   - Relative paths → prefixed with BACKEND_URL if set
   - Empty strings → returned as empty

### Frontend Testing

1. **Product Rendering**
   - Open shop.html in browser
   - Verify products display correctly
   - Check DevTools Elements tab:
     - ✓ Images have `loading="lazy"` attribute
     - ✓ Images have `width="300" height="300"` attributes
     - ✓ Buttons have `class="add-to-cart"` and `data-id` attributes
     - ✓ No inline `onclick` attributes

2. **Add to Cart Functionality**
   - Click "Add to Cart" button
   - Verify:
     - ✓ Product added to cart (cart count increases)
     - ✓ No console errors
     - ✓ Event delegation works (check event listeners in DevTools)

3. **Default Placeholder Image**
   - Create product with empty image: `image: ""`
   - View product on shop page
   - Verify: Default avatar image displays

4. **HTML Escaping (XSS Prevention)**
   - Create product with HTML in name: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
   - View product on shop page
   - Verify: Script tag is escaped and visible as text, not executed

5. **Lazy Loading Images**
   - Open shop.html with DevTools Network tab
   - Scroll down slowly
   - Verify: Images only load when scrolled into view (not all at once)

## Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- `backend/index.js` - Added helmet, rate limiting, logger, error handler
- `backend/routes/products.js` - Added logger, media utils, admin rate limiter
- `public/shop.js` - Added lazy loading, event delegation, HTML escaping
- `package.json` - Added helmet dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with helmet dependencies

### Files Created
- `backend/utils/logger.js` - Structured logging wrapper
- `backend/utils/media.js` - Image URL normalization utilities
- `DEV_NOTE.md` - Comprehensive development guide
- `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Security Improvements
1. ✓ Helmet security headers protect against common vulnerabilities
2. ✓ Rate limiting prevents API abuse
3. ✓ HTML escaping prevents XSS attacks
4. ✓ Centralized error handling prevents information leakage
5. ✓ Removed inline onclick with JSON.stringify (CSP-friendly)

## Performance Improvements
1. ✓ Lazy loading images reduces initial page load
2. ✓ Event delegation reduces memory usage
3. ✓ Image dimensions reduce layout shift (CLS)

## Code Quality Improvements
1. ✓ Structured logging for better observability
2. ✓ Centralized utilities reduce code duplication
3. ✓ Consistent error handling across routes
4. ✓ Cleaner frontend code with event delegation

## Known Limitations
- Rate limiting is in-memory (resets on server restart)
- For multi-instance deployments, consider Redis-backed rate limiting
- Default placeholder image uses default-avatar.png (could be product-specific)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run manual tests from this document
3. Monitor rate limit violations in logs
4. Consider adding integration tests
5. Plan migration to Firebase Storage for all images
