# CSV Batch Upload & Product Editing - Quick Reference

> **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR PRODUCTION

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

This feature adds major capabilities to the admin upload page:

1. **CSV Batch Upload** - Upload up to 100 products at once from a CSV file with intelligent parsing
2. **Smart Duplicate Detection** 🆕 - Automatically prevent duplicate products from being added
3. **Product Management** - Edit and delete uploaded products

### Intelligent CSV Parser
The CSV uploader uses PapaParse for accurate, robust parsing that:
- ✅ Correctly handles multi-line field values (descriptions, etc.)
- ✅ Processes quoted fields containing commas
- ✅ Filters out empty rows and non-product metadata automatically
- ✅ Supports RFC 4180 compliant CSV files
- ✅ Works seamlessly with Etsy CSV exports
- ✅ Accurately counts only valid products (not total lines)

### Smart Duplicate Detection 🆕
The uploader now prevents duplicate products:
- ✅ Checks both product names and descriptions for similarity
- ✅ Intelligently handles minor edits and typos
- ✅ Recognizes color differences (Blue vs Red = different products)
- ✅ Skips duplicates automatically with detailed reporting
- ✅ Perfect for re-uploading Etsy CSVs after description changes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Batch Size Limit
- **Maximum:** 100 products per CSV upload
- **Reason:** Prevent server overload and ensure reasonable processing time
- **Workaround:** Split larger batches into multiple files

### Required Fields
Every product must have:
- ✅ Name (or TITLE)
- ✅ Description (or DESCRIPTION)
- ✅ Price (or PRICE) - must be numeric

### Image Handling
- **CSV:** Provide image URL in `image` or `IMAGE1` column
- **Edit:** Upload new image file or keep existing

### Admin Emails
Only these emails have admin access:
- shaunessy24@gmail.com
- bonnielassflorals@gmail.com

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid CSV data"
- **Cause:** Empty file or wrong format
- **Solution:** Check CSV has header row and data rows

### "Batch size limited to 100 products"
- **Cause:** CSV has more than 100 valid products (accurately counted)
- **Solution:** Split into smaller batches
- **Note:** The parser now accurately counts only valid product rows, not total lines

### "No valid products found"
- **Cause:** CSV rows don't contain name/title field or have insufficient data
- **Solution:** Ensure CSV has header row with 'name' or 'title' column and at least 3 fields per product

### "Missing required fields"
- **Cause:** Product missing name, description, or price
- **Solution:** Ensure all required columns are filled

### "Please login first"
- **Cause:** Not authenticated
- **Solution:** Login with admin credentials

### "Admins only"
- **Cause:** Not an admin user
- **Solution:** Use an admin email address
