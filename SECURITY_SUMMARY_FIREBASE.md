# Security Summary - Firebase Storage Migration

## Overview
This document summarizes the security considerations and measures implemented in the Firebase Storage migration.

## Security Enhancements

### Client-Side Validation

#### File Type Validation
- **Allowed types**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP only
- **Implementation**: `uploadImageToFirebase()` validates `file.type` against whitelist
- **Error handling**: Clear error message for invalid file types

#### File Size Validation
- **Maximum size**: 10MB
- **Implementation**: Checks `file.size` before upload
- **Error handling**: Clear error message for oversized files

#### Filename Sanitization
Enhanced sanitization to prevent security issues:
- **Special characters**: Replaced with underscores using regex `/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g`
- **Path traversal**: Removed sequences like `..` using `/\.{2,}/g`
- **Leading dots**: Removed to prevent hidden files
- **Length limit**: Truncated to 100 characters max
- **Timestamp prefix**: Added to ensure uniqueness and prevent collisions

Before: `../../../etc/passwd`
After: `1234567890-___etc_passwd`

### Server-Side Security

#### Firebase Storage Rules
```javascript
match /product-images/{imageName} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public read for product display
  allow write: if request.auth != null                      // Must be authenticated
              && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024    // Max 10MB
              && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');  // Images only
}
```

Rules enforce:
- Authentication required for uploads
- File size limit (10MB)
- Content type validation (images only)

#### Backend Authentication
- **Firebase Admin Auth**: All product mutations require valid Firebase token
- **Admin emails whitelist**: Only specific emails can access upload endpoints
- **Rate limiting**: 10 requests per minute per IP

#### Input Validation
- **express-validator**: Validates all product fields
- **Sanitization**: Options and other text fields sanitized
- **Type checking**: Price, stock validated as numbers

### API Key Security

#### Firebase API Key
```javascript
// NOTE: API key is public by design - security is enforced by Firebase Storage Rules
// which require authentication and validate file types/sizes server-side
const firebaseConfig = { apiKey: "..." }
```

**Important**: Firebase API keys are designed to be public in client-side code. Security is enforced through:
1. Firebase Storage Rules (authentication required)
2. Backend authentication (admin-only endpoints)
3. Rate limiting

This is the standard Firebase security model and is documented in Firebase official docs.

### Vulnerability Mitigation

#### Multer Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: Multer v1.4.5-lts.1 has known DoS vulnerabilities:
- CVE: Denial of Service via unhandled exception
- CVE: Denial of Service via memory leaks

**Mitigation**:
- **Primary flow**: Uses Firebase Storage (no multer involved)
- **Fallback flow**: Multer only processes multipart/form-data
- **Limited exposure**: Admin-only endpoints with authentication
- **Rate limiting**: 10 requests/min limits DoS impact
- **Future plan**: Remove multer entirely once all workflows confirmed

**Impact**: Minimal (primary flow doesn't use multer)

#### Path Traversal
**Protection**:
- Client-side filename sanitization removes `..` sequences
- Firebase Storage enforces path structure (`product-images/...`)
- No direct filesystem access in primary flow

#### XSS Prevention
**Protection**:
- Image URLs stored and returned as strings (no script execution)
- HTML output uses `escapeHtml()` and `escapeAttr()` functions
- Firebase Storage serves images with proper Content-Type headers

#### CSRF Protection
**Protection**:
- Firebase authentication tokens required
- Rate limiting prevents automated attacks
- No cookies used for authentication

## Security Testing

### CodeQL Analysis
- **JavaScript scan**: 0 alerts
- **No high/critical vulnerabilities detected**

### GitHub Advisory Database
- **Dependencies scanned**: express, multer, express-validator, firebase-admin
- **Known vulnerabilities**: Multer DoS (mitigated - see above)
- **Action taken**: Documented mitigation strategy

### Manual Security Review
- [x] File type validation implemented
- [x] File size validation implemented
- [x] Filename sanitization enhanced
- [x] Authentication required
- [x] Rate limiting in place
- [x] Input validation via express-validator
- [x] API key security clarified
- [x] Firebase Storage Rules configured

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation (client + Firebase Rules + backend)
2. **Least Privilege**: Admin-only access to upload endpoints
3. **Input Validation**: All user input validated and sanitized
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
5. **Secure Storage**: Firebase Storage provides enterprise-grade security
6. **Clear Documentation**: Security considerations documented

## Recommendations

### Immediate
✅ All implemented - no immediate actions needed

### Short Term (1-3 months)
1. Monitor Firebase Storage usage and costs
2. Review and update Storage Rules as needed
3. Consider additional file scanning (malware detection)

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. Remove multer dependency entirely
2. Migrate existing local uploads to Firebase
3. Implement automated image optimization
4. Add admin UI for managing uploaded images

## Compliance

### Data Privacy
- No personal data stored in images
- Public read access appropriate for product images
- Admin authentication prevents unauthorized uploads

### GDPR Considerations
- Product images are business data (not personal)
- Firebase Storage Terms of Service compliant
- No user-uploaded content (admin-only)

## Incident Response

### If Unauthorized Upload Detected
1. Revoke user's Firebase authentication token
2. Delete unauthorized images via Firebase Console
3. Review and tighten Storage Rules if needed
4. Check backend logs for suspicious activity

### If Storage Rules Misconfigured
1. Images remain secure (authentication required)
2. Update rules via Firebase Console
3. Test with non-admin account to verify
4. Monitor for any unauthorized access attempts
